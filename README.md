# Shriekers-Circle

# Game Description
Embark on a chilling journey through the eerie landscape of Mizzouâ€™s college campus in "Shriekers Circle." As a student trying to make it to class, the main character finds themselves trapped in the ominous Speaker's Circle, where saying "no" has dire consequences. Upon declining an offer from a seemingly harmless individual in Speaker's Circle, the benign facade crumbles, revealing a grotesque and terrifying monster that will stop at nothing to hunt them down. Their only escape is to navigate through the campus, completing essential side objectives before reaching the safety of their classroom. Navigate the treacherous terrain, evade the monstrous pursuer, and undertake tasks such as grabbing a quick bite from the cafe, picking up their textbooks, and meeting with professors. With each passing level, the stakes get higher. It gets later into the day, and the monster becomes more formidable. The final level, set at night during a relentless downpour, pushes their survival skills to the limit. The clock is ticking, and the nightmare intensifies with each passing day. Welcome to the Shriekers Circle, where survival is the only objective.
